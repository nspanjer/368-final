<h2>The Decade</h2>
			

<p>Small Time Crooks (2000) is similar to the 1942 film Larceny, Inc. (from a play by S.J. Perelman).
 Allen never commented on whether this was deliberate or if his film was in any way inspired by it. 
Small Time Crooks was Allen's first film with the DreamWorks studio and represented a change in direction: 
Allen began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots. The film was a relative 
financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, 
including Allen's most costly film, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (with a budget of $26 million). Hollywood Ending, 
Anything Else, and Melinda and Melinda were given "rotten" ratings from film-review website Rotten Tomatoes and each 
earned less than $4 million domestically. Some critics claimed that Allen's films since 1999's Sweet and Lowdown 
were subpar and expressed concern that Allen's best years were now behind him. Others have been less harsh; reviewing 
the little-liked Melinda and Melinda, Roger Ebert wrote, "I cannot escape the suspicion that if Woody had never made a previous 
film, if each new one was Woody's Sundance debut, it would get a better reception. His reputation is not a dead shark but an 
albatross, which with admirable economy Allen has arranged for the critics to carry around their own necks." Woody gave 
his godson Quincy Rose a small part in Melinda and Melinda. Allen was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences in 2001. Match Point (2005) was one of Allen's most successful films of the decade, garnering positive reviews.
Set in London, it starred Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson. It is markedly darker than Allen's first four films with 
DreamWorks SKG. In Match Point, Allen shifts focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of 
London. It earned more than $23 million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62 million in 
international box office sales. Match Point earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998, for Best Writing – 
Original Screenplay with directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987. In an 
interview with Premiere Magazine, Allen stated this was the best film he has ever made. Allen returned to London to film Scoop, 
which also starred Johansson, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Kevin McNally and Allen himself. The film was released on July 28, 2006, 
and received mixed reviews. He filmed Cassandra's Dream in London. Cassandra's Dream was released in November 2007, and stars 
Colin Farrell, Ewan McGregor and Tom Wilkinson. After finishing his third London film, Allen headed to Spain. He reached an agreement 
to film Vicky Cristina Barcelona in Avilés, Barcelona and Oviedo, where shooting started on July 9, 2007. The movie stars Scarlett Johansson, 
Javier Bardem, Rebecca Hall and Penélope Cruz. Speaking of his experience there, Allen said: "I'm delighted at being able to work 
with Mediapro and make a film in Spain, a country which has become so special to me." Vicky Cristina Barcelona was well received, winning 
"Best Musical or Comedy" at the Golden Globe awards. Penélope Cruz received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in 
the film. Allen has said that he "survives" on the European market. Audiences there tend to be more receptive to his films, particularly in 
Spain, France and Italy – countries where he has a large audience (joked about in Hollywood Ending). "In the United States things have changed a 
lot, and it's hard to make good small films now," Allen said in a 2004 interview. "The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films – 
if they get a good film they're twice as happy but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million." 
In April 2008, he began filming a story focused more towards older audiences starring Larry David, Patricia Clarkson and Evan Rachel Wood. 
Released in 2009, Whatever Works, described as a dark comedy, follows the story of a botched suicide attempt turned messy love triangle. 
Whatever Works was written by Allen in the 1970s and the character played by Larry David was written for Zero Mostel, who died the year Annie Hall came out.
