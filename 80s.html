<h2>The Decade</h2>
			

<p>Allen's 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, with 
their influences being the works of European directors, specifically Ingmar Bergman and 
Federico Fellini. Stardust Memories was based on 8 1/2, which it parodies, and Wild Strawberries. 
A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy was adapted from Smiles of a Summer Night. In Hannah and Her 
Sisters, part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from Fanny and Alexander. 
Amarcord inspired Radio Days. September resembles Autumn Sonata. Allen uses many elements 
from Wild Strawberries. In Crimes and Misdemeanors, Allen references a scene from Wild 
Strawberries. A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy was the first of 13 movies Allen made starring 
Mia Farrow, who stepped into Diane Keaton's role when Keaton was shooting Reds. Stardust Memories
 features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and 
scorn for his fans. Overcome by the recent death of a friend from illness, the character states,
 "I don't want to make funny movies any more" and a running gag has various people (including 
visiting space aliens) telling Bates that they appreciate his films, "especially the early, 
funny ones."[41] Allen believes this to be one of his best films. Allen combined tragic and 
comic elements in such films as Hannah and Her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanors, in which 
he tells two stories that connect at the end. He produced a vividly idiosyncratic tragi-comical 
parody of documentary, Zelig. He made three films about show business: Broadway Danny Rose, 
in which he plays a New York show business agent, The Purple Rose of Cairo, a movie that shows 
the importance of the cinema during the Depression through the character of the naive Cecilia, 
and Radio Days, a film about his childhood in Brooklyn and the importance of the radio. The 
Purple Rose of Cairo was named by Time as one of the 100 best films of all time and Allen 
described it as one of his three best films, along with Stardust Memories and Match Point. 
(Allen defines them as "best" not in terms of quality but because they came closest to his 
vision.) In 1989, Allen teamed with directors Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese to 
make New York Stories, an anthology film about New Yorkers. Allen's short, Oedipus Wrecks, 
is about a neurotic lawyer and his critical mother. His short pleased critics, but New York 
Stories bombed at the box office.</p>
