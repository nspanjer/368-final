<h2>The Decade</h2>
			

<p>Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) Take the Money and Run in 1969, 
which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with United Artists to produce several 
films. Those films eventually became Bananas (1971, co-written with Rose), Everything You Always 
Wanted to Know About Sex* (1972), Sleeper (1973), and Love and Death (1975). Sleeper was the 
first of four films where the screenplay was co-written by Allen and Marshall Brickman.
In 1972, Allen wrote and starred in the film version of Play It Again, Sam, directed by Herbert 
Ross and co-starring Diane Keaton. In 1976, he starred in The Front (directed by Martin Ritt), 
a humorous and poignant account of Hollywood blacklisting during the 1950s. Then came two of 
Allen's most popular films. Annie Hall won four Academy Awards in 1977, including Best Picture, 
Best Actress in a Leading Role for Diane Keaton, Best Original Screenplay and Best Director for 
Woody Allen. Annie Hall set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend 
with the clothes worn by Diane Keaton in the film. While in production, the working title was 
"Anhedonia", a term that means the inability to feel pleasure and the plot revolved around 
a murder mystery. Allen re-cut the movie after production ended to focus on the romantic 
comedy between Allen's character, Alvy Singer, and Keaton's character, Annie Hall. The new 
version, retitled Annie Hall (named after Keaton, Hall being her original last name and Annie 
a nickname), deals with the inability to feel pleasure. The film is ranked at No. 35 on the 
American Film Institute's "100 Best Movies" and at No. 4 on the AFI list of "100 Best Comedies."
Manhattan, released in 1979, is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York 
City. As in many Allen films, the protagonists are upper-middle class academics. The love-hate 
opinion of cerebral persons found in Manhattan is characteristic of many of Allen's movies, 
including Crimes and Misdemeanors and Annie Hall. Manhattan focuses on the complicated 
relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and a 17-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway).
Between Annie Hall and Manhattan, Allen wrote and directed the dark drama Interiors (1978), 
in the style of the late Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, one of Allen's chief influences. 
Interiors represented a departure from Allen's "early, funny" comedies (a line from 1980's 
Stardust Memories).</p>
