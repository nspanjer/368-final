<h2>The Decade</h2>
			

<p>His 1992 film Shadows and Fog is a black-and-white homage to the German expressionists and 
features the music of Kurt Weill. Allen then made his critically acclaimed drama Husbands and 
Wives (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for Judy Davis and 
Best Original Screenplay for Allen. His film Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) combined suspense 
with dark comedy and marked the return of Diane Keaton, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston. He 
returned to lighter movies like Bullets Over Broadway (1994), which earned an Academy Award 
nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, Everyone Says I Love You (1996). The 
singing and dancing scenes in Everyone Says I Love You are similar to musicals starring Fred 
Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The comedy Mighty Aphrodite (1995), in which Greek drama plays a 
large role, won an Academy Award for Mira Sorvino. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama 
Sweet and Lowdown was nominated for two Academy Awards for Sean Penn (Best Actor) and 
Samantha Morton (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen 
veered into darker satire towards the end of the decade with Deconstructing Harry (1997) 
and Celebrity (1998). Allen made one sitcom "appearance" to date (2009) via telephone on the 
show Just Shoot Me! in a 1997 episode, "My Dinner with Woody" which paid tribute to several 
of his films. Allen provided the lead voice in the 1998 animated film Antz, which featured 
many actors he had worked with and Allen's character was similar to his earlier neurotic roles.
