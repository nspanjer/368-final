<h2>The Decade</h2>
			

<p>You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, filmed in London, stars Antonio Banderas, Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins, Anupam Kher, Freida Pinto 
and Naomi Watts. Filming started in July 2009. It was released theatrically in the US on September 23, 2010, following a Cannes debut in 
May 2010, and a screening at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2010. Allen announced that his next film would be 
titled Midnight in Paris, starring Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Michael Sheen, Gad Elmaleh 
and Carla Bruni, the First Lady of France at the time of production. The film followed a young engaged couple in Paris who see their lives 
transformed. It debuted at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 2011. Allen said he wanted to "show the city emotionally," during the press 
conference. "I just wanted it to be the way I saw Paris – Paris through my eyes," he added. Midnight in Paris has overtaken Hannah and Her 
Sisters as Allen's most successful film at the box office in the United States. It opened to critical acclaim, and was considered by many 
critics to mark his return to form. His next film, To Rome with Love, was a Rome-set comedy released in 2012. The film was structured in four 
vignettes featuring dialogue in both Italian and English. It marked Allen's return to acting since his last role in Scoop. Allen's most recent 
release, Blue Jasmine, debuted summer 2013, with post-production having been finished earlier in the year. The film is set in San Francisco 
and New York, and stars Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Louis C.K., Andrew Dice Clay, Sally Hawkins, and Peter Sarsgaard. It opened to critical 
acclaim and holds a 91 percent approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2013, in Nice, France, Allen shot a comedy Magic in the Moonlight 
that will star Emma Stone and Colin Firth, and will be set in 1930s France.
